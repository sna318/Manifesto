      <p>
        She/they. Black, female-identifying, femme, queer writer and curator
        born and raised in NYC. Executive Director & Chief Curator at The
        Kitchen. Raised in Saint Marks Place, right when the East Village in NYC
        was getting gentrified. LuvPunk12.
        <i>Glitch Feminism</i>
        was published in 2020, but the original paper commissioned by
        <i>Rhizome,</i>
        "Digital Dualism and the Glitch Feminism Manifesto," was published in
        2012. This manifesto is born out of the highs and lows of Legacy's
        experiences as a queer Black femme, as well as the experiences of
        artists and activists who've glitched.

      <h2>Advocates for...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Embracing yourself as a glitch - reject the confines of gender and
          body
        </li>
        <li>
          Embracing the multiplicity of being your online and offline self
        </li>
        <li>Taking up space on the Internet</li>
        <li>Unplugging if you need to - ignore texts, messages, ads</li>
        <li>
          Not caring if your existence causes the Internet to short circuit
        </li>
        <li>Defining who YOU are</li>
        <li>
          Encrypting your presence on the Internet - you choose who gets to know
          the bits and pieces of your identity
        </li>
        <li>Experimenting with your identity</li>
        <li>Accepting and embracing slowness, malfunctions</li>
        <li>
          Creating a mess and coding errors into machines that are designed and
          ruled by white patriarchy
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="rejects" class="glitch_universal box">
      <h2>Rejects...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The idea of IRL - your digital persona is very much real</li>
        <li>The urge to shrink back and fit in</li>
        <li>Being afraid of breaking something</li>
        <li>The fixed idea of what a body looks like and how it functions</li>
        <li>
          Self-categorization - don't use autofill, protect your data, don't
          tick off that box
        </li>
        <li>
          The notion that the Internet is alienating - reclaim space for
          yourself
        </li>
        <li>Electronic colonialism and mass consumerism</li>
